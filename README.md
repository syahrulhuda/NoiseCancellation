## 📋 Overview
**Noise Killer Workbench** is a desktop application designed to restore audio recordings contaminated by stationary noise (such as fans, air conditioners, or wind rumble). Unlike basic noise reducers, this tool allows users to fine-tune Digital Signal Processing (DSP) parameters in real-time, offering a balance between noise suppression and audio fidelity.

Built with **Tkinter** for the GUI and powered by **SciPy**, **NumPy**, and **NoiseReduce** for the backend, this project demonstrates the practical application of filters and spectral analysis in Telecommunications Engineering.

## ✨ Key Features
* **🎛️ Precision Control:**
    * **Low Cut Filter (HPF):** Adjustable cutoff (20-400Hz) to surgically remove low-end rumble (fan/wind).
    * **Reduction Strength:** Controls the depth of attenuation (0% - 100%).
    * **Aggressiveness:** Fine-tunes the spectral gating threshold to distinguish between noise and voice.
* **📊 Visual Analysis:**
    * Real-time visualization of **Raw Input**, **Clean Result**, and **Removed Noise Profile**.
* **📈 Smart Metrics (New!):**
    * **SNR Estimator:** Automatically calculates the estimated **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (dB)** improvement.
* **⏯️ A/B/C Comparison:**
    * Dedicated **"Play Orig"** and **"Play Clean"** buttons for instant before-after testing.
    * **🗑️ Listen to the Noise:** Isolate and play back only the noise that was removed to verify what you're cutting.
* **🧠 Audio Preservation:**
    * Features a **Presence Recovery** system (2kHz-5kHz boost) to prevent the "muffled" sound typical of aggressive denoising.

## 🛠️ Technical Methodology

The audio processing pipeline follows a strict DSP chain:
1.  **Frequency Isolation (Bandpass Filter):**
    * *Input:* Raw Audio Signal.
    * *Process:* Butterworth Filter (Order 5).
    * *Goal:* Removes mechanical rumble (<100Hz) and high-frequency digital hiss (>10kHz) before processing.
2.  **Spectral Gating (The "Noise Killer"):**
    * *Process:* Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) computes the signal spectrogram.
    * *Logic:* A dynamic threshold (controlled by the `Aggressiveness` slider) separates noise bins from signal bins.
    * *Smoothing:* A **2.0-second time constant** is applied to the noise mask to prevent "crackling" artifacts.
3.  **Presence Recovery (Post-Processing):**
    * *Process:* A gentle gain boost in the vocal presence range (2kHz - 5kHz).
    * *Goal:* Restores clarity and "air" to the vocals.

## 💻 Installation Guide (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.
### 1. Prerequisites
* **Python:** Make sure Python (3.8 or newer) is installed. [Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **Git:** Make sure Git is installed. [Download Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### 2. Clone the Repository
Open your Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and run the following commands:
```bash
# 1. Navigate to the folder where you want to save the project (e.g., Desktop)
cd Desktop

# 2. Clone this repository (Download the code)
git clone git@github.com:syahrulhuda/NoiseCancellation.git

# 3. Enter the project folder
cd NoiseCancellation
```

### 3. Setup Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.

For Windows:
```bash
# Create environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS / Linux:
```bash
# Create environment
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Once the environment is active (you will see `(venv)` in your terminal), install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib librosa soundfile noisereduce
```

## 🚀 How to Use

**Run the App:**
Make sure your terminal is still inside the project folder and the `venv` is active, then run:
```bash
python app.py
```

**Workflow:**
1. Click **📂 Load Audio File** and select a noisy `.wav` file.
2. **Adjust Sliders:**
    * **Low Cut:** ~100Hz (for fans).
    * **Strength:** ~0.90.
    * **Aggressiveness:** ~0.40.
3. Click **⚡ PROCESS AUDIO**.
4. Wait for the graphs to appear.
5. **Check Results:**
    * Look at the yellow SNR text to see the improvement.
    * Use the **▶ Orig** and **▶ Clean** buttons to hear the difference.
